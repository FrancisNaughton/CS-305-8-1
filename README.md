Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
     Artemis Financial is a financial company that consults with clients and creates financial plans for them. They approached us and asked us to create a web application that is secure and equipped to handle sensitive information.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
     For identifying software vulnerabilities, I performed static testing. It is essential to code securely in order to protect sensitive information for both the company and the clients. The clients put their trust in the company to keep their information safe. Having good software security is necessary to protect the company from attacks that could potentially have destructive financial repercussions. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
       I found the dependency check to be a very useful tool for finding vulnerabilities.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
     I approached the need to increase security logically. Firstly, reviewing the code is necessary for catching possible vulnerabilities in the code. Then static testing should be conducted. In the future, I would conduct more testing to expose more vulnerabilities. 

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
     I ensured that the code and application were secure and functional by running it and viewing the results. I checked the new dependency check report to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
     I utilized the internet and the knowlegable people to get to the bottom of errors and bugs. From this assignment, I would showcase the cipher algorithm SHA512 that was deployed.
